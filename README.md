_WORK IN PROGRESS_


The shader can be edited through [Amplify Shader Editor](http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor) and contributions to the project are always welcome!

Project developed using **Unity 2018.3.0b6**. Please use this version if you are planning on contributing. You can work on your own branch and send a pull request with your changes.

You can also just download a **unitypackage** from the [releases tab](https://github.com/AdultLink/HoloShield/releases) and easily import everything to your project. This will not download the _media_ folder.
